# ssht

SSH Tool


Features:

- SSH host management
- Docker support

ssht detects hosts from your `~/.ssh/config` file, running Docker containers, with more plugins coming soon.

When ssht starts, it will ask you for a host to connect to, and provide a search prompt. This prompt performs out-of-order searches on multiple hidden and visible fields. You can search by common fields such as user/port/hostname/ip/source, and advanced queries such as port ranges, wildcards, and more. 

This tool is in the prototype stage.
